Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, run:

    npm run dev

This will start both the React development server and the Electron application.
